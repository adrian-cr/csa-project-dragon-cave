# Project: Dragon Cave

## The Story
A knight-errant finds
himself in front of two ominous caves,
each of which is home to unsurmountable
riches—and a mighty, fire-breathing dragon.
One of them will warmly welcome the knight
and share some of its treasure with him,
while the other will mercilessly devour him
as soon as he enters. Which cave shall our
valiant knight choose? 

## The Program
In this simple decision-making program,
the user must choose one of two options.
If they guess right, the program will print
a congratulatory message, otherwise, it will
print a losing message instead. In both cases,
the program will stop its execution right
afterward.
* The winning choice is determined
at random and stored in `winningChoice`, while

Thou hast found Kmerilwaleg, the fearsome dragon
of Hufrilgrex, kingdom of the Tenebrous Lord. Lurking from the top of
a mountain of jewels and gold, it sett its eyes upon thee. With an evil
gaze and a vicious smirk, it breatheth a sun-like fireball and spiteth it
into the ground, setting ablaze everything underneath. Kmerilwaleg's cruel
wrath hath become our valiant knight's last sight...

*****YOU LOSE!*****
